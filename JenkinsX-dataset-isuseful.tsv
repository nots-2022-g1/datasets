fix: revert making all created repos private by defaultreverts #5284. as seen in #5507, we weren't ever actually testing thiscorrectly (due to `--git-public false` actually resulting in`--git-public` being true and `false` being treated as additionalarguments to `jx create cluster`). fixing that showed thatpromote-to-production fails when using the github user as the env repoowner as well, which is problematic in and of itself, but moreimmediately, we can't get tests to pass without creating a second userto own the private env repos or an org that allows private repos. thisis blocking anything from getting merged in `jenkins-x-versions`,which means more and more things can be slipping into the periodic prsthere that could be introducing more failure cases we can't detect, etc.so...we should revert and revisit.signed-off-by: andrew bayer <andrew.bayer@gmail.com>	True

fix: handle lighthouse-specific hmac secret in update_webhookssometimes, but weirdly not always, when switching from prow tolighthouse, the `hmac-token` secret gets deleted. currently, prow andlighthouse use the same name for that secret, so i believe thatlighthouse installs and then prow gets removed, resulting inlighthouse not needing to create the secret, since it's identical tothe prow one, but then the removal of prow deleting the secret (andpossibly the `hook` service - still trying to verify that).as i said, this doesn't happen consistently - i've now switched acluster from prow to lighthouse, back to prow, and back to lighthouse,and the first time, prow didn't get deleted at all, then the secretstuck around after the installation of prow and removal of lighthouse,and stuck around again after the installation of lighthouse andremoval of prow. so...i don't know if this is just random bad luck or what.regardless, i'm going to change lighthouse to use a unique secretname, but `jx update webhooks` needs to know that secret name. solet's have it try the prow name, and then if that's not found, try thenew lighthouse namepart of fixing #7154signed-off-by: andrew bayer <andrew.bayer@gmail.com>	True

fix: allow `jx boot --no-update-git` to not mess with gitwhen testing out a possible pr on the git boot repository referenced in the `jx-requirements.yml` even using `--no-update-git` i was finding that boot would:* lookup my local fork of the git repository and since its not in the version stream assume 'master' was the branch i wanted (despite being in a fork/branch already* re-apply all changes from master to my local checkout causing merge hell* then `jx step verify env` tries to push to master the local changes merged with upstream causing merge conflicts etc.this pr fixes this by disabling the bit of `jx boot` which switches from the current gitref -> `master` if the `--no-update-git` is provided. that flag also passes in an env var so that `jx step verify env` doesn't try to push local changes to master of the dev repo (which is only really intended for real installs from the real upstream git repo - not from local forks trying changes out in boot config).there's an additional minor change for helmfile to disable lazily creating the dev environment if helmfile is used; which breaks helmfile/helm 3 which wants to create/update that resource via helmsigned-off-by: james strachan <james.strachan@gmail.com>	True

fix: cloning for environments shouldn't leave strange state in jx_homeuntil this, `jx delete app`, `jx add app`, and `jx get apps` all didweird things with/under `~/.jx/environments`. all of them used`forkandpullrepo` to clone under there - `jx get apps` directly into`~/.jx/environments`, and `jx add app` and `jx delete app` into`~/.jx/environments/dev`. literally none of this made sense. =)this reworks not just the app commands, but all commands that createprs (i.e., gitops) against the dev/prod/staging environments to use temporarydirectories for the fork/clone/push, with the option, just used intests, of specifying an existing directory to use instead, while `jxget apps` just clones to a temporary directory as well.switching all this to temporary directories also really helps userswho manage/work with multiple jx clusters from a singlelaptop/desktop/host, since namespacing `~/.jx/environments` by clusteris basically impossible so far as i can tell.also adds `--auto-merge` to `jx delete app` because i was here.fixes #6350signed-off-by: andrew bayer <andrew.bayer@gmail.com>	True

fix(pipeline): add git_* env vars to non-pod template imagesif a step uses an image that isn't a pod template alias, like `go` or`maven`, and instead uses an image name, with or without tag, such as`kaniko/executor` or `gcr.io/jenkinsxio/builder-go:2.0.902-250`, wehaven't been adding all the environment variables that pod templatesautomatically include, meaning those env vars aren't set unlessthey're explicitly specified in the `jenkins-x.yml` or build pack. sofar as i can tell, the only ones we're missing right now are`git_author_name` and friends. so this pr adds them.figuring out exactly the right value to use is a challenge. the podtemplates all have `jenkins-x-bot` and `jenkins-x@googlegroups.com` asthe name/email, but it feels like it'd be better to use`pipelineusername` and `pipelineuseremail` from team settings...ifthey're set. since `pipelineuseremail` was just added a month and ahalf ago, we can't assume it's going to be set in existing installs,even after updating, so we'll use those values if they're not empty,and fall back on the defaults if needed.i also added constants for the default values, because why not.fixes #5615signed-off-by: andrew bayer <andrew.bayer@gmail.com>	True

feat(serve-buildnumbers): add new cmd to serve build numbers over http interface.add a new command `jx serve-buildnumbers` that will run an http interface to serve up build numberssimilar to prow's tot. the interface is the same as tot's (i.e. /vend/<id>) to get the next sequentialbuild number.as used in jenkins-x <id> is owner/repository/branch, e.g. get /vend/owner1/repo1/master -> 6the backend logic for managing/generating build numbers is exactly as per `jx step next-buildnumber`, which isusing pipelineactivity crds.i think it makes sense for this to eventually move _out_ of the jx command line tool, but that's where it is for now.

fix: upgrade tekton to 0.8.0, remove knative buildnote that the original plan was to upgrade to 0.9.x, but that turnsout to be...messy. tekton 0.9.x depends on k8s 1.13.x at compile time,which results in a bunch of mock/fake changes being needed on ourside. going to 0.8.0, with its dependency on k8s 1.12.x, did requiresome changes, but not as many.and more importantly than changes here, going to k8s 1.13.x at compiletime results in breaking changes to compilation for knative build andserving, cert manager, and bankvault. while some of these can besolved by upgrading, knative build ended at 0.7.0 (which depends onk8s 1.12.x, and which we're upgrading our dependency to here, eventhough we also remove all the knative build usage here at the sametime), and even if we remove our `go.mod` dependency on knative build,we then end up pulling in 0.2.0 thanks to our prowdependency. so...things need to be reworked in some janky ways toupgrade all the way to 0.9.2.this also removes knative build - the addon is left around for now,but any code actually using it is gone. go.mod still references it,because otherwise we'd pick up knative build 0.2.0 via depending onprow, which would just mix things up more. i'm working on a prowchange to remove knative build there which will completely eradicateknative build.fixes #6317, #4230signed-off-by: andrew bayer <andrew.bayer@gmail.com>	True

fix: creating dev env repo should come from github, even with different target providersthe default upstream boot config repo that's used as the basis forcreating the dev env repo for a new cluster is, at least as of now,always on github.com, but `duplicategitrepofromcommitish` only uses asingle `gitprovider`, meaning that if you're using github enterprise,or gitlab, etc, the attempt to get information needed about theupstream repo in order to create the dev env repo tries to look forthe upstream repo's org/name in the provider that will have the devenv repo in it. which is bad.so instead, let's check if the provider we'll be creating in is notgithub.com and the upstream boot config repo we're going to use as thebasis for the dev env repo *is* on github.com, and if so, use adifferent provider to get the required information.fixes #6315signed-off-by: andrew bayer <andrew.bayer@gmail.com>	True

fix: step next-version and helm 3fixes #7564this makes the `jx step next-version` command compatible with helm 3 when it reads/writes `chart.yaml` files.when the `jx step next-version` command reads the version from a chart.yaml file, it looks for the `version` string, reads the value and stops there.but when it writes a version in a chart.yaml file, it replaces all the values following the `version` string.this was not an issue with helm 2, because there used to be a single `version` field in the chart.yaml file.but in helm 3, the dependencies have been moved inside the chart.yaml file, which means that each dependency now has a `version` field.as a result, when the `jx step next-version` updates a version, it replaces all versions (including the dependencies) with the new value - which is incorrect.this commit fixes this behaviour by stopping after the first replacement. it expect people to write the main chart version before the dependencies.signed-off-by: vincent behar <v.behar@free.fr>	True
